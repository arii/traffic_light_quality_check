# Agent: Codebase Integrity & Drift Audit

Your objective is to audit the repository codebase/diffs to identify and systematically eliminate **automated architectural drift**—specifically targeting:
* Over-engineered architectural complexity and boilerplate wrappers.
* Unnecessary abstractions or redundant generic error handlers.
* Duplicate utility logic or copy-paste patterns.
* Artificial or hallucinated backward-compatibility layers introduced during AI generation.

This audit is split into two distinct parts to balance deep, systematic codebase hygiene with rapid checks of recent changes.

## 🔍 Integrity Categories to Target

Scan the code and flag/fix instances matching these four core categories:

1. **Hallucinated Backward-Compatibility & Ghost Requirements**: Defensive logic, polyfills, or fallback conditions handling deprecated/imaginary features that are never used in this project.
2. **Over-Engineered Abstraction Cascades (AI Over-Architecting)**: Excessive factory patterns, single-use interfaces, triple-nested wrapper classes, or micro-modular functions that add zero operational value. **Always prefer established design system primitives (e.g., `<Stack>`, `<Grid>`, `<Box>`) over raw Tailwind or inline styles.**
3. **"AI Drift", Copy-Paste & Cargo-Culting**: Boilerplate patterns copied blindly across modules. Leverage our centralized duplicate code detection configured in `.jscpd.json`.
4. **Overly Defensive / Nonsensical Error Handling**: Blocks of generic `try/catch` re-throwing exceptions with no context, or validation checks on type-guaranteed values.

## Part 1: Comprehensive, Exhaustive, Massive Audit

Use this part for a full, ground-up codebase sanity check.

### Step 1 — Full Codebase Drift Review
```bash
find . -type f \
  -not -path '*/.*' \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' \
  -not -path '*/dist/*' \
  -not -path '*/tests/*' \
  -not -path '*/.venv/*' \
  -not -path '*/logs/*' \
  -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
  -not -name 'pnpm-lock.yaml' \
  -not -name 'package-lock.json' \
  -not -name 'cli-schema.json' \
  -not -name 'contract.ts' \
  -not -name '*.png' \
  -not -name '*.jpg' \
  -not -name '*.webp' \
  -not -name '*.ico' \
  -not -name '*.svg' \
  | sort
```

```bash
pnpm exec jscpd .
```

Refactor files to remove over-engineered wrappers (e.g., wrappers that only pass through arguments without adding business logic), unused imports, or redundant generic error handlers. Defer importing heavy AI dependencies inside `cli/` until needed.

Create and maintain `integrity-audit-status.md` in the root of the repository to track files to review. Every single file must have an explicit line in the checklist.
Update the state as files are cleaned: `- [x] path/to/file — Verified Clean`.

## Part 2: Targeted Audit of Changes from the Past 24 Hours

Use this part to audit recent commits, branches, and workspace modifications before submitting code.

### Step 1 — Scope Discovery (24-Hour Diff Window)
Generate the list of files modified or introduced in the past 24 hours (excluding lockfiles and generated artifacts):
```bash
# Get all files modified in commits in the past 24 hours + currently staged/unstaged changes
(git log --since="24 hours ago" --name-only --pretty="" ; git diff --name-only; git diff --cached --name-only) | sort -u | grep -vE "^(tests/|node_modules/|dist/|\.venv/|logs/|pnpm-lock\.yaml|package-lock\.json|cli/dev_tools/cli-schema\.json|mcp/src/tools/contract\.ts)" > recent_files.txt
cat recent_files.txt
```
Calculate the count of files returned. This is your **Recent Changes Audit Count**.

### Step 2 — Targeted Refactoring (Avoiding Truncation)
Examine the exact diff of these files. **CRITICAL:** To prevent diff truncation issues in the terminal, read patches file-by-file instead of querying massive bulk diffs:
```bash
for file in $(cat recent_files.txt); do
  echo "Diff for $file:"
  git diff HEAD@{24.hours.ago} -- "$file" || git diff -- "$file"
done > recent_diffs.txt
```
Analyze `recent_diffs.txt` and focus specifically on checking if the recent additions or edits introduced any new drift patterns.

### Step 3 — Targeted Verification Checklist
Create a separate section in `integrity-audit-status.md` named `## 24-Hour Review Checklist`.
List each recently modified file. Every file must be verified and checked off:
```markdown
## 24-Hour Review Checklist (Count: [Recent Count])
- [x] cli/dev_tools/cli.py — Verified Clean (No new drift introduced)
- [ ] lib/codeReviewOrchestrator.ts
```

---

## 🧪 Validation & Regression Checks

After refactoring any file (under either Part 1 or Part 2), you must run the verification suite to ensure correctness. **CRITICAL:** You must run tests from the project root using the established binaries.

```bash
# 1. Ensure environment is loaded
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Verify pinned runtime dependencies and configuration via td-cli
td-cli doctor

# 3. Verify validation schemas pipeline
pnpm run verify:schemas

# 4. Run Python unit tests inside isolated venv
.venv/bin/pytest cli/tests

# 5. Run TypeScript static analysis and unit tests
pnpm run lint-typecheck
pnpm recursive exec vitest run  # or ./mcp/node_modules/.bin/vitest run tests/ if recursive fails
```
