# Release Process

boomtick uses automated release pipelines for both the Python CLI and the TypeScript MCP tools.

## Versioning Strategy

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for all components.

- **CLI**: Versions are managed in `cli/pyproject.toml`.
- **MCP**: Versions are managed in `mcp/package.json`.

## Triggering a Release

Releases are triggered by pushing specific Git tags:

- **CLI Release**: Push a tag matching `cli-v*` (e.g., `cli-v0.2.1`).
- **MCP Release**: Push a tag matching `mcp-v*` (e.g., `mcp-v0.2.1`).

## Automated Release Drafting and Changelog

We use **Release Drafter** and **git-cliff** to automate our release notes and changelog updates.

### Conventional Commits Requirement
It is **critical** to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) syntax (e.g., `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`, `refactor: ...`) for all commits. `release-please` strictly relies on this format to parse commits, evaluate changes, and bump versions appropriately. Commits starting with capitalized words (like `Refactor`, `Fix`, `Continue`) without conventional formatting will cause parsing errors, resulting in `release-please` skipping candidate PR generation for the affected components.

### Release Drafting
Whenever a Pull Request is merged into `main`, **Release Drafter** automatically updates a draft release with the changes.
- It categorizes changes based on PR labels (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`).
- It automatically suggests the next version number.

### Automated Changelog
When a new release is **published**, a GitHub Action triggers **git-cliff** to:
1. Parse the git history using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
2. Generate a new entry for `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Prepend the entry to the top of the file and commit it back to the repository.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Update Version**:
   - For CLI: Update `version` in `cli/pyproject.toml`.
   - For MCP: Run `pnpm --filter @arii/boomtick-mcp version <patch|minor|major>`.

2. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to x.y.z"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Create and Push Tag**:
   ```bash
   # For CLI
   git tag cli-v0.2.1
   git push origin cli-v0.2.1

   # For MCP
   git tag mcp-v0.2.1
   git push origin mcp-v0.2.1
   ```

## Automated Pipelines

### Release CLI (`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`)
- Triggers on `cli-v*` tags.
- Runs CLI unit tests.
- Builds MCP tools and bundles them into the CLI distribution.
- Syncs schemas and contracts.
- Builds the Python package (`sdist` and `wheel`).
- Publishes to PyPI.
- Creates a GitHub Release with generated notes and artifacts.

### Release MCP (`.github/workflows/release-mcp.yml`)
- Triggers on `mcp-v*` tags.
- Runs MCP unit tests.
- Builds the TypeScript project.
- Publishes to npm (under the `@arii` scope).
- Creates a GitHub Release with generated notes.

### Changelog Update (`.github/workflows/changelog-update.yml`)
- Triggers when a release is published.
- Uses `git-cliff` to generate release notes from conventional commits.
- Prepends new notes to `CHANGELOG.md` and commits the change.

## Manual Dispatch

Both workflows can be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI for dry-runs or debugging.
