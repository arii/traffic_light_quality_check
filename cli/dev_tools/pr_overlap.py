    """
    Identifies structural overlaps between open Pull Requests by analyzing modified file sets.

    This function fetches open PRs from the repository, retrieves the list of modified files
    for each PR, and identifies groups (clusters) of PRs that share at least one common file.
    These clusters are useful for identifying potential merge conflicts or functional
    dependencies that might necessitate PR consolidation.

    Args:
        github: An instance of GitHubClient to interact with the GitHub API.
        limit: The maximum number of open PRs to retrieve for analysis.

    Returns:
        A list of cluster dictionaries, each containing:
            - 'prs': A list of PR numbers in the cluster.
            - 'files': A list of filenames shared across the PRs in the cluster.
            - 'metadata': A dictionary mapping PR numbers to their full PR details.
