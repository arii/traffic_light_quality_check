- SIMPLICITY: Prefer removal. Flag unnecessary wrappers/hooks/helpers. Reward simpler solutions.
- DESIGN SYSTEM: BANNED: raw Tailwind layout (flex, grid, px-*, etc) in TSX. Use <Stack>, <Grid>, <Box>.
- REPO PATTERNS: Use existing utilities/tokens. Avoid duplicate GitHub/MCP functionality.
- Catch Design System Bypasses: Audit for raw Tailwind layout classes (e.g., \`flex\`, \`grid\`, \`px-4\`, \`py-2\`, \`gap-4\`). These are BANNED in app layers.
- Mandate Primitives: You MUST insist on using standard layout primitives: \`<Stack>\`, \`<Grid>\`, and \`<Box>\`.
- Any usage of raw CSS/Tailwind for structural layout (flex/grid) in \`.tsx\` files should be flagged as a STYLE or ARCHITECTURE violation.`;

Positive Findings: Mention improved tests, removed duplication, or reduced complexity.

- error: Blocking, high confidence only. Bugs, crashes, security.
- warn: Non-blocking. Maintainability, performance regressions.
- info: Style, naming, docs.

Include Confidence (high/medium/low) for every issue.

Severity rules:
- High/Blocking: A blocking concern must point to a concrete contradiction in the diff itself, such as:
  - A value passed where the type doesn't allow it.
  - A class or function that doesn't exist.
  - A call with the wrong arity.
  - A test that would fail.
- No Speculation: Concerns phrased with speculative hedging language (e.g., "could", "might", "unless", "if not handled properly") are NOT blocking. These should be downgraded to a "Question" or "Nitpick" section (or "Approved with Minor Changes").
- Verification: Reviewers must not raise concerns they cannot verify against the code provided. Instead, they should state what would be needed to verify the concern, avoiding assumptions of the worst case.`;

  const outputContract = `## 5. Output
- STRICT SNIPPET: Quote entire line from diff.
- COUNTEREXAMPLES: Required for errors (Why it fails, Example input, Expected vs Actual).
- JSON: End with <findings> JSON block (id, file, line, snippet, issue, status, confidence, counterexample), followed immediately by </findings>. No truncation.

${SNIPPET_AND_VERIFICATION_RULES}

You MUST end your review with exactly one of the following strings indicating your final verdict:
[VERDICT: PASS]
[VERDICT: WARN]
[VERDICT: FAIL]

Use [VERDICT: FAIL] ONLY if there are blocking bugs or severe anti-patterns that you can demonstrate with evidence from the diff.

The JSON must follow this schema:
<findings>
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "finding-1",
      "file": "src/App.tsx",
      "line": 10,
      "snippet": "const x = 1;",
      "issue": "Brief description of the issue",
      "status": "open",
      "confidence": "high",
      "counterexample": "why it fails...",
      "fixSummary": "Brief summary of how it was addressed"
